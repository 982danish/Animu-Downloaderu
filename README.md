*PS.* **I would gladly pay for anime and I do not promote downloading anime illegally, downloading copyright materials is a serious crime.
This service is for those who are unable to watch their favorite anime due to region specific restrictions.**
yeah, I can't even watch one-piece because of the same reason. :/
