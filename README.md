# Animu-Downloaderu

## Notes

1. Now has two Servers (Anime1, and GogoAnime),
1. Uses AnimeCrawlerAPI [github](https://github.com/codingotaku/AnimeCrawlerAPI) [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codingotaku/AnimeCrawlerAPI) for fetching Anime.
1. Modified code so that it would be easier to add new servers in the future! ([this file](https://github.com/codingotaku/Animu-Downloaderu/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingotaku/apps/source/AnimeSources.java))
We might add more servers in the future! 
1. Android version coming soon!

 **I do not support piracy!**, The only reason for me making this app was because of the DRM/licensing crap that mainstream anime hosing services created and the ad+tracking bullshit in other websites adopted to.
