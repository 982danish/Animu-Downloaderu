# Animu-Downloaderu

## Notes

1. Removed Server 2,
1. Modified code so that it would be easier to add new servers in the future! ([this file](https://github.com/codingotaku/Animu-Downloaderu/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingotaku/apps/source/Source.java))

 We might add more servers in the future! 

 Anime1 server should work, but I cannot guarantee on when the videos gets blocked. 

 **I do not support piracy!**, The only reason for me making this app was because of the licensing crap that mainstream anime hosing services created and the ad+tracking bullshit in other websites adopted to.
